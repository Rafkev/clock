# clock
Dart console application for a company clock-in system.
This program allows employees to clock in and out, view their total working hours for the day, and view their total working hours for the week.


This Dart application provides a menu-driven interface where employees can clock in, clock out, and view their total working hours for the day or week. Employee data is stored in a map with the employee's name as the key and an Employee object as the value. Each Employee object contains lists of clock-in and clock-out timestamps.
